Teaching Learning Management
</p>

<p>
Every semester we go through the planning process for imparting
quality education and measure the effectiveness of teaching learning
process.
</p>

<p>
Some of the tasks we undertake today, mostly carried out manually,
are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Registration of students in the first week of the semester.
</li>
<li>Preparing students list and sharing with all teachers for marking attendance
</li>
<li>Subject allotment that feeds into creating time table and feedback forms
</li>
<li>Creating course file and teaching slides
</li>
<li>Conducting internals for 15 marks and continuous assessment for 5 marks
</li>
<li>Sending reports about attendance and internal marks to the guardians
</li>
<li>Feedback from students about faculty twice in a semester
</li>
<li>Finally analyzing the exam results
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Management platform
</p>

<p>
Finding solutions to a problem may be based on the following
approaches: Buy, build or integrate.
</p>

<p>
The option of buying is generally expensive. And the product may not
be the best fit for the problem.
</p>

<p>
Building from scratch is time consuming and maintenance costs are
prohibitive. Any attrition and transitioning skills is painful.
</p>

<p>
Integrating a solution from open source tools is attractive as it is
free and the only investment is acquiring the skills to integrate.
</p>

<p>
AIT has received google G suite consisting of software tools for
creating documents, forms, classrooms and unlimited storage capacity
for education.
</p>

<p>
And a separate domain www.atria.edu for collaborating mails between
teachers, students and guardians.
</p>

<p>
The G suite tools work seamlessly between desktops, palmtops and
chrome books. Chrome books are tailor made for better experience with
G suite.
</p>

<p>
We have been using google drive for storage and forms from the
individual accounts but not yet integrated the student community.
</p>

<p>
Off the shelf platform such as G suite is better than in house
development due to long support needed in maintenance and
enhancements.
</p>

<p>
What is google classroom?
</p>

<p>
The classroom tool in G suite help collaborating some of the above
tasks with all the stake holders - teachers, students, guardians and
management. Can customize the above tasks, if required, that are 
unique to  our institute using the google app scripts.
</p>

<p>
Organizing class rooms tasks around G suite enable students to access
64 courses all the time in their 4 year BE. And teachers will have the
access to courses they have created over a period of time.
</p>

<p>
Others management tasks such as recording attendance, internal marks,
feedback etc. have to be handled independently. The Feedback task has
already been addressed using google forms and same can be extended for
other remaining management tasks.
</p>

<p>
Solution to management tasks with google forms is future proof,
scalable, secure and easy to manage. The LMS system that have been
tried out in the past are too complex and not successful.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Classroom prototype.
</p>

<p>
The prototype of classroom for "Computer Networks" course has been
tried out in CSE department. Where students joined the class with
their gmail IDs. The teacher shared class room material like lesson
plan, question bank, class notes, etc. In addition questions, quizes
and assignments to students for continuous assessment. 
</p>

<p>
The quizes and questions are graded and returned to students as
feedback. End of the course, the summary of each students grades
available in one place for objective assessment.
</p>

<p>
The prototype classroom was conducted that used the gmail accounts of
students. However, creating emails in our institute domain
www.atria.edu is desirable.
</p>

<p>
Google forms for management tasks.
</p>

<p>
Google forms is one of the excellent medium for data collection. It
has limited facilities for data analysis.
</p>

<p>
The google forms required for keeping track of the management
activities such as registration, attendance, feedbacks, internal
marks, etc have been created.
</p>

<p>
There are two types of forms i) static form ii) dynamic forms. Static
forms are complete by itself and does not dependent on external
data. For example, allotment form and registration form. Dynamic forms
are generated based on external data. Example of dynamic forms are
feedback forms that uses data about subject allotments, attendance
forms that uses student lists of the sections.
</p>

<p>
The suitable reports about attendance, internals, etc will be
generated periodically say once every week. Reports every day may be
considered based on the experience gained from weekly reports.
</p>


<p>
What Next?
</p>

<p>
Create mail accounts for all students with www.atria.edu domain. Train
the staff regarding google classroom. And train the class coordinators
regarding google forms for management tasks. Finally store the student
lists, section wise, in a spread sheet.
